'''
Variables are used in programming to store data of various types
I will introduce you to many data types that you can use in your programs!
In some programming languages you need to tell the program what kind of data to expect
For example, in Java you need to tell the program what kind of data you want to store
You also need to give the variable a name

int myNum = 15;

This line of code would declare (create) an integer variable named myNum

In Python, you only need to give the variable a name and assign a value to it.
'''

print("\n")

myNum = 15
myString = "hello, world"

print(myNum)
print(myString)

print("\n")

We will learn much more about using variables with Python soon!

Note: Variable names are CASE-SENSITIVE!!!
The following lines of code would actually create two separate variables, be careful!
'''

x = 3
X = 4
#X will not overwrite x

print(x)
print(X)
