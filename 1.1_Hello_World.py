'''
The "Hello, World!" program is the first program for many devlopers
By creating this program you are now officially a programmer!
Allow me to be the first to welcome to the world of programming!

In Python, you will write Python (.py) files
These files will be executed in the python interpreter
I created a Hello World.py file right here in Visual Studio Code
You are welcome to use any Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

This program only has one line of code and the output should be hello, world
It's as simple as that!
'''

print ("hello, world\n")

'''
You can check the version of Python by importing the sys module
We will need to import many modules throughout our coding journey
Importing a module gives you access to more functionality!
Let's use the sys module to check the version of Python that we are using
Modules that I import will be at the very beginning of my programs 
We will learn more about many more modules as we go along!

print(sys.version + "\n\n\n")
